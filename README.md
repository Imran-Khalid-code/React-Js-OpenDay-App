# Exercise

Front end development often requires you to consume data from an external location and present it in an appropriate manner. We have provided the response from a simple API call that contains a JSON object of information relating to a past Open Day. We would like you to use HTML, CSS (CSS, Sass or Less) and JavaScript/TypeScript to read the object (this can be as simple as including the object as a variable) and display it in an organised manner. In addition, you should add in a sorting/searching mechanic to the front end. Feel free to use any frameworks you would like to achieve the task.
